# Modeling and Optimization of Management Problems

## Overview

This project covers the contents studied in the subject "Modeling and Optimization of Management Programs" of the Master's Degree in Industrial Engineering of the University of Seville.

These files present the implementation of three different optimization problems: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). For this purpose, the following optimization algorithms will be studied:

* Bruteforce (BF)
* Nearest Neighbour (NN)
* Cost Saving (CS)
* Local Search (LS)
* Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) and Descendant (VND)
* Simulated Annealing (SA)
* Tabu Search (TS)
